///! This crate provides an executor for asynchronous task with the same
///! API as [`futures-executor::ThreadPool`] targeting the web browser
///! environment. Instead of using spawning threads via `std::thread`, web
///! workers are created. This crate tries hard to make this process as
///! seamless and painless as possible.
///!
///! For further information and usage examples please check the [repository].
